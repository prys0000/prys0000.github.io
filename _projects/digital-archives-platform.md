## Project Title: Digital Archives and Content Platform Development

### Duration
August 2018 – "Ongoing"

### Institution
Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center Archives

### Project Overview
This foundational project transformed the Center’s digital archive from a modest collection of **118 digital files** into a robust, scalable platform housing **over 586,000 digital assets**, including:
- Text (document, bound ledgers, maps, books, etc.)
- Photograph images (negatives, positives, slides)
- Audio recordings (antiquated format specialization)
- Video content (antiquated format specialization)

The platform was designed to support long-term preservation, accessibility, and scholarly research.

### Technical Innovation
To manage and process this vast and diverse dataset, I developed and implemented **custom adaptive learning models**. These models enabled:
- **Automated metadata extraction**
- **Content classification and tagging**
- **Format normalization**
- **Search optimization**

This approach significantly reduced manual labor and improved the discoverability and usability of archival materials.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Machine Learning**: Custom adaptive models
- **Digital Asset Management**: Automated migration, preservation migration, security management
- **Metadata Standards**: Dublin Core, EAD, METS, PREMIS, PBCore, MARC, EBUCore, WARC, CAC+
- **Storage & Access**: AWS (S3, Glacier, Storage Gateway) and Google Cloud (Storage, Transfer, server-side encryption, gsutil), local servers

### Outcomes
- Archive grew from **118 to over 586,000+** files
- Improved access for researchers, educators, and the public
- Created a scalable model for future digital preservation projects
