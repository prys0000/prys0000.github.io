## Project Title: Congressional Portal Project

### Duration
2022 – "Ongoing"

### Institution
Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center Archives

### Project Overview
The **Congressional Portal Project** is a collaborative research initiative to improve accessibility and analysis of congressional archival records. It provides a repository of workflows, instructional materials, controlled vocabularies, and automated tools to enhance large-scale processing of archival text files.

The project integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **OpenAI’s GPT models** to automate metadata extraction and standardization across collections. This enables fast, scalable access to previously underutilized congressional materials.

### Background
- **Partnerships**: West Virginia University Libraries, Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics, Robert C. Byrd Center, The Dirksen Congressional Center, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, and the Russell Library.
- **Goal**: Build a centralized portal to unify and interpret congressional collections.
- **Focus Area**: Emphasizes **American Indian sovereignty** and policy-related materials.
- **Evolution**: Evolved from disparate tools into a [streamlined workflow](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/blob/501b9ba0b95882a39753b41a3562e6434d29e5a7/workflows/README-Workflow.md) integrating facial recognition, controlled vocabularies, feedback loops, and MPI-based parallel processing.

### Key Tasks
- **Adaptive Learning Models** for accuracy in metadata extraction
- **Feedback Loops** to improve NLP results and vocabulary evolution
- **Standardization Frameworks** for consistent metadata
- **Human-Centered Design** models to improve usability

## Automating Archival Processes

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **NER**: Identify names, locations, and organizations
- **Topic Modeling**: Detect major themes
- **Text Classification**: Connect documents to pre-defined vocabularies
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand tone and political leanings
- **Entity Linking**: Match terms to authoritative entities

### Feedback & Verification
- **Contextual Analysis**: Account for figurative language
- **Multi-step Verification**: For people, dates, organizations
- **Controlled Vocabularies**: Ensure accurate tagging and annotation
