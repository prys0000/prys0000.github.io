## Project Title: Political Campaign Commercial Collection Reprocessing

### Duration
2021 – "Ongoing"

### Institution
Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center Archives  
(In collaboration with Harvard University and the University of Iowa)

### Project Overview
The Carl Albert Center Archives, along with Harvard University and the University of Iowa, was awarded a **collaborative research grant** from the **National Science Foundation (NSF)** for the project:  
**"Understanding the Evolution of Political Campaign Advertisements over the Last Century."**

The project focused on three major aims:
1. Make a large underutilized collection of **over 120,000 political ads (1912–2016)** suitable for academic and public research.
2. Understand the **evolution of political advertising**, particularly regarding **issue advocacy** and **gender/minority representations** before 1996.
3. Promote **interdisciplinary education** in audiovisual analysis for graduate and undergraduate researchers.

Our task at the Carl Albert Center focused on **aim #1**, delivering a cleaned, structured, and accessible dataset for collaborators. This page documents our process and the innovative solutions developed during the reprocessing effort.

### Key Research Components
- Addressed challenges of **insufficient documentation**, **undefined workflows**, and **limited funding**.
- Developed **scalable workflows** for managing large AV collections.
- Ensured **long-term access and usability** of digital ad materials.
- Shared **practical solutions** for academic archival environments.

## Workflow Documentation & Resources

### Case Study & Collection Background
- Origin, acquisition, and growth timeline of the ad collection  
- Collection complexity and disorder: the **entropy effect**

### Infrastructure & System Challenges
- Backlogs due to “**internet effect**” and constant digital growth  
- Issues with format normalization, file duplication, and legacy media

### Initial Tools & Methods
- Python templates for batch renaming, classification, metadata mapping  
- Control methods: **Unified Component ID (P_COPY-OID)** system  
- Audio/video **data cleansing, aggregation, forensic analysis**

### Implementation & Phase 1 Workflow
- Digitization and file intake  
- Batch tagging, error detection, AI-assisted classification  
- Manual QC and correction protocols

### Sample Student Access Workflows
- Group A–B: **Basic metadata cleanup**  
- Group C: **Enhanced tagging & AV sync corrections**  
- Group QA-Rover-1: **Advanced metadata validation & exception reporting**
