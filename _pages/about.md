I lead the archives team at the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center, managing historical materials from the late 1800s to today. My focus is developing better systems for long-term digital collection management.
As both an archivist and educator, I help bridge the gap between technology and collection management. I work to make information more accessible through collaborative approaches.

I hold a master's in Library and Information Science with Digital Content Management specialization and a master's in Museum Science focusing on Digital Asset Management. I'm currently completing my PhD in Information Science at the University of North Texas, studying large-scale digital asset management.

My goal is to preserve our historical collections while making them available to researchers and the public using the best practices in the field.

Data-driven, Efficiency-Focused Research
======
My research focuses on the impact of information system components (data + human) and the ability to process information (product) efficiently. My work centers on cultural heritage content/information management systems and workflow methodology. I am interested in measuring the rate and efficiency of information flow by exploring traditional goal and system models and forecasting models to predict or prevent possible barriers and obstructions from subsystem to the end product.

Current Large-Scale Projects
======
The Carl Albert Center, along with the University of West Virginia, Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics, the Dirksen Congressional Center, and the Richard B. Russell Library of Political Research, received $1.5 million in congressionally directed spending to expand utility, usability, and capacity of the [American Congress Digital Archives Portal](https://congressarchives.org/) and to equip K-12 educators with resources and tools for refortified civics and history education. 

The Carl Albert Center Archives, along with Harvard University and the University of Iowa, was awarded collaborative research grant funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the project ["Understanding the Evolution of Political Campaign Advertisements over the Last Century"](https://github.com/prys0000/political-commercial-collection-archives).

The [Congressional Portal Project](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main) provides a repository for workflows, methodologies, instructional materials, controlled vocabularies, and more. This repository was created to house large-scale project efficiency methodologies and automated workflows and to document strategies throughout the project timeline. The project scope focuses on materials relating to the American Congress from the Carl Albert Research and Studies Center Archives. 

The [Archives Handwriting Text Extraction and Analysis Project](https://github.com/prys0000/archives-handwriting-text-extract-project) was developed to create and test versatile text extraction and cleaning tools available through local applications or by AWS Textract. This flexibility allows the tools to align with a specific repository or project requirements and facilitate local file processing and customization.
