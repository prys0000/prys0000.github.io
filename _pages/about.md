As the Senior Archivist III, I provide leadership and direction for the [Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center Archives](https://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter/congressional-collection) distinguished repository of manuscripts, photographs, audiovisual materials, and born-digital assets from the late 1800s. My primary professional objective is to advance adequate infrastructure and long-term digital collection management strategies. As a committed archivist, educator, and collaborator, I have significantly contributed to the profession through my leadership, advocacy, and program development skills. 

As a practitioner and educator, I can foster interdisciplinary collaborations and offer innovative concepts bridging the technology and collection management gap. As a collaborator, I strive to explore inclusive and inventive methods to broaden access to information. My academic qualifications include a master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) with a specialization in Digital Content Management and a master's degree in Museum Science (M.S.) with a focus on Digital Asset Management. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at the University of North Texas, concentrating on large-scale digital asset management.

Data-driven, Efficiency-Focused Research
======
My research focuses on the impact of information system components (data + human) and the ability to process information (product) efficiently. My work centers on cultural heritage content/information management systems and workflow methodology. I am interested in measuring the rate and efficiency of information flow by exploring traditional goal and system models and forecasting models to predict or prevent possible barriers and obstructions from subsystem to the end product.

Current Large-Scale Projects
======
The Carl Albert Center, along with the University of West Virginia, Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics, the Dirksen Congressional Center, and the Richard B. Russell Library of Political Research, received $1.5 million in congressionally directed spending to expand utility, usability, and capacity of the [American Congress Digital Archives Portal](https://congressarchives.org/) and to equip K-12 educators with resources and tools for refortified civics and history education. 

The Carl Albert Center Archives, along with Harvard University and the University of Iowa, was awarded collaborative research grant funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the project ["Understanding the Evolution of Political Campaign Advertisements over the Last Century"](https://github.com/prys0000/political-commercial-collection-archives).

The [Congressional Portal Project](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main) provides a repository for workflows, methodologies, instructional materials, controlled vocabularies, and more. This repository was created to house large-scale project efficiency methodologies and automated workflows and to document strategies throughout the project timeline. The project scope focuses on materials relating to the American Congress from the Carl Albert Research and Studies Center Archives. 

The [Archives Handwriting Text Extraction and Analysis Project](https://github.com/prys0000/archives-handwriting-text-extract-project) was developed to create and test versatile text extraction and cleaning tools available through local applications or by AWS Textract. This flexibility allows the tools to align with a specific repository or project requirements and facilitate local file processing and customization.
