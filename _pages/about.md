About
======
I am a digital archivist with 14 years of experience in congressional and cultural heritage repositories. I currently serve as Senior Archivist III and Curator at the Carl Albert Congressional Research Archives, as well as an Instructor of Information Science at the University of Oklahoma. I hold an M.L.I.S. in Digital Content Management and an M.S. in Museum Science, and I am completing a Ph.D. in Information Science with a focus on Archival Informatics.

Data-driven, Efficiency-Focused Research
======
My research focuses on the impact of information system components (data + human) and the ability to process information (product) efficiently. My work focuses on cultural heritage content and information management systems, as well as workflow methodologies. I am interested in measuring the rate and efficiency of information flow by exploring traditional goal and system models, as well as forecasting models, to predict or prevent possible barriers and obstructions from the subsystem to the end product.

Large-Scale Projects
======
The Carl Albert Center, along with the University of West Virginia, Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics, the Dirksen Congressional Center, and the Richard B. Russell Library of Political Research, received $1.5 million in congressionally directed spending to expand utility, usability, and capacity of the [American Congress Digital Archives Portal](https://congressarchives.org/) and to equip K-12 educators with resources and tools for refortified civics and history education.

### Current, On-going Projects
  - The Carl Albert Center Archives, along with Harvard University and the University of Iowa, was awarded collaborative research grant funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the project ["Understanding the Evolution of Political Campaign Advertisements over the Last Century"](https://github.com/prys0000/political-commercial-collection-archives).

  - The [Congressional Portal Project](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main) provides a repository for workflows, methodologies, instructional materials, controlled vocabularies, and more. This repository was created to house large-scale project efficiency methodologies and automated workflows and to document strategies throughout the project timeline. The project scope focuses on materials relating to the American Congress from the Carl Albert Research and Studies Center Archives. 

  - The [Archives Handwriting Text Extraction and Analysis Project](https://github.com/prys0000/archives-handwriting-text-extract-project) was developed to create and test versatile text extraction and cleaning tools available through local applications or by AWS Textract. This flexibility enables the tools to align with specific repository or project requirements, facilitating local file processing and customization.
