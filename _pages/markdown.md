    * Funding Entity: National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC), $1.5 million

* [Historical Collection of Political Campaign Advertisements: Online Archiving, Automated Coding, and Scientific Analysis (co-PI)](https://s-lib024.lib.uiowa.edu/campaignvids/index.html):
    * Funding Entity: National Science Foundation
    * Funding Unit: Accountable Institutions and Behavior (AIB) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)
    * Collaborative Partners: Harvard University and Purdue University
    * Abstract: Television advertising, a primary way voters hear about candidates absent a media filter, is ubiquitous in political campaigns in the United States. Drawing on an existing but underutilized data set of over 100,000 political ads, this project examines the evolution of political advertising, especially as it pertains to issue advocacy and unity.  The project makes significant methodological and substantive contributions to several fields, including political, information, and library sciences, enhancing our understanding of how ads shape and inform political behavior.  It also promotes interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate education at research and teaching institutions in the emerging sub-field of automated audiovisual analysis, including students and scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The project uses a collection of over 100,000 political ads from 1912-2018, the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Collection archived at the University of Oklahoma, to develop (1) an automated system to identify issues (and other politically relevant) content from ad image, audio, and text and (2) a state-of-the-art user interface that gives researchers the ability to query, interact with and view videos, and also output data for analysis.  The project uses the data to examine the evolution of political advertising, testing models of horizontal and vertical diffusion of issues.  The project’s tools and data, introduced at an interdisciplinary workshop, are widely available to scholars from various disciplines studying American politics, campaigns, political communication, and public opinion.

    * Funding Entity: National Endowment for the Humanities
    * Funding Unit: Division of Preservation and Access, Humanities Collections and Reference Resources

    * Abstract: To further develop and expand the first-ever online portal, bringing together congressional archives from repositories throughout the United States. The portal promises to bring historical congressional materials to the fingertips of more scholars, educators, and public members. It could revolutionize the study and understanding of Congress and its importance in American democracy. The American Congress Digital Archives Portal is a non-partisan project that addresses these challenges and provides more accessible, more accessible access to congressional archives. By digitizing congressional archives from multiple institutions across the country and making them available through one website (Portal), the public can discover and access thousands of historical records of Congress from anywhere. The prototype Portal, created with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, currently aggregates materials from WVU Libraries, the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at The University of Kansas, and the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education (Shepherd University, West Virginia).
